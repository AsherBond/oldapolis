She worked the DJ gig until she graduated from college and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a music industry career. Mollie got her start in A&R assisting the Senior Vice President A&R at RCA/BMG Records. She parlayed that experience into working front line A&R, scouting new acts for Velvet Hammer Music and Management. She was quickly promoted to full time A&R scout for Velvet Hammers' prestigious joint venture with Columbia Records. Less than a year later, Mollie was recruited by Atlantic Records as their Director A&R. At Atlantic A&R she works with top acts such as Kid Rock, Jason Mraz, Rush, Missy Elliott, Paulo Nutini and Stone Temple Pilots, as well as discovering and handling new artists like Kitten - a fresh young band that was named Artist of the Year and best new discovery at this year's South by Southwest (SXSW) music industry conference in Austin, Texas.
